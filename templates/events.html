Meet the best team of determined, optimistic and amazing people coming together after doing a number of tasks while surviving in the different rounds of selections in which they have to showcase their skills and have to be unique and different from others. Carrying a brilliant perception of understanding things and working under the guidance of an exceptionally helpful and cooperative board, we came up with a team of such amazing, versatile and enthusiastic people who are looking forward to so many opportunities and a very bright future working together. With the support of all we grew not as a team but as a single unit, a family i.e one for all, all for one."</p> {% endcomment %}

                          think in multiple directions, connect the dots, and make sense out of seemingly random clues. Some effective googling
                          and some out of box thinking was required for this event.

                            Unrealism was a group discussion event organized on 21st March 2021.It was an event which tested a completely different
                            skill set along with out of box thinking. As promised, (Un)realism created a memorable and unique
                            event filled with teamwork, but at the same time, it helped in portraying individual personalities.

                            Techtonic was a coding event organised on 19th March. It provided a platform for all the geeks to brainstorm and work
                            out some coding problems within a time duration of three hours. This event was a test of knowledge and ability to work
                            under pressure. It showcased how efficiently you can work on any given problem and find a solution that is simple yet
                            effective.
